## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to analyze historical data on online courses usage and build predictive models to understand trends, compare platforms, and make future predictions. The project involves the following key tasks:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing
- Training models (LSTM, KNN, K-Means Clustering)
- Visual reporting and analysis
- Predictive modeling

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains features such as:
- `feature1`: Description of feature 1
- `feature2`: Description of feature 2
- `target_column`: The target variable for prediction
- `date_column`: Date information for time series analysis
- `platform_column`: Categorical variable representing different online platforms

*Note: Replace `feature1`, `feature2`, etc., with the actual column names from your dataset.*

## Requirements
